OK so perfect so when you go to the playground dashboard I've already designed some UI there what I want you to do is to change the text and write something like this feature or this part of the app is currently under development and implementation and will be coming soon. line 115

#file:PlaygroundDashboard.jsx


OK so perfect everything is going on well except for one last issue you see that when it is found the first button should be changed to the start search button which is the blue button but then even when it is found here it shows pause which shouldn't be so so I want you to look closely into the code and try fixing that issue
