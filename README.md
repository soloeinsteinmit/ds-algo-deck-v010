# Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Visualizer

Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help students, developers, and educators learn data structures and algorithms in an engaging way. This tool allows users to explore and manipulate various data structures and algorithms with visual representations. Users can view a real-time visualizer on the left and an interactive code editor on the right, enabling them to write and execute code, view code samples, and observe step-by-step changes in the visualizer. The project is built with React and JavaScript, integrating advanced features for user engagement and learning, including API integrations for code generation.
